# NLP classifier
NLP classifier for Twitter. 

This repo contains a Twitter scrapper to download tweets related to 5G and COVID-19 because of the controversy generated in some countries about the relationship of this techonology with the virus.

Appart from that, there are two dataset, the one achieved by executing this scrapper and other one related to emotions in tweets.

These datasets were not clean at first, so a preprocessing notebook is needed to delete useless data.

Finally, once there are clean data sources, there are two notebooks which test different algorithms to create a NLP classifier for both cases.
